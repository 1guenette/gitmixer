# Development setup

1. Use python's venv module 
    - ([pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is a great alternative)
    ```
    $ python -m venv <dependency directory>
    ```
    - by default ".venv" is used as the <dependency directory> and is utilized in the project's `.gitignore`
2. Activate the virtual environment in your shell
    ```
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
